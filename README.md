Tool for generative design created with moving dos, conneting lines, curves, geometries and repetition.



The user completes the work  adjusting the folowing paramters:


Dots: activate  the drawing only with dots.

Play: toggle  on and off the payback frame rate. The animations are 'moved' by the Perlin Noise algorithm.

Weight: change the thickness of the 'pen.

nDots: change the number of dots from 0 to 6.

lines: throw straight  lines between points.

curves: throw curve lines between points.

square: draw a moving square centered  and rotating between the points. 

circle: draw a moving square centered  and rotating between the points.

chagingRadius:  its toggles on and off changing width and height of the circle and square.

triangle: draw a moving mutating triangle.

red, green, blue and alpha levels:  change the color levels of the drawing with sliders.

bg_red, bg_green, bg__blue and alpha levels:  change the background colors and background level (cool blurring).

nFrames:   create longer or short  'traces ' moving the( values get stored as 'life span'). Change from 1 to a 1000  instances

res: draw instances closer or farther from each other.

Press 'p' in your keyboard to export and save an image from your canvas.
